Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do. The following example specifies a Ruby project that should be built with Ruby 2.2 and the latest versions of JRuby.
language: ruby
rvm:
 - 2.2
 - jruby
YAML
The defaults for Ruby projects are bundle install to install dependencies, and rake to build the project.
Add the .travis.yml file to git, commit and push to trigger a Travis CI build:
Travis only runs builds on the commits you push after you’ve added a .travis.yml file.

Check the build status page to see if your build passes or fails according to the return status of the build command by visiting Travis CI and selecting your repository.
